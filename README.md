# MySQL-JDBC-CRUD-Multiple-Data-Insertion-with-Multiple-Generated-Keys
Project Implemented during Mysql Studies with JavaEE/JDBC to Test and Implement Simultaneous Multiple Insertions Query with JDBC API Classes (PreparedStatement()/ResultSet()) and its Methods (.executeUpdate/ .next()). The Program also implements a returnProperty method in its DB class in order to Read and Load the db.properties txt File throughout FileInputStream and Properties Class . In this Program, besides the change of Synthax at the Command Query to insert more than one mySQL Table Row at once, Polymorphism was also explored at PreparedStatement Object's usual Constructor with Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS additional parameter, and the concept of Getting Multiple DataBase-Generated Keys (PKs) from the multiple Inserted data was applied.
